## How to use

### Whisper
Create and initialise the container for the model. The medium model is ~3G and can take some time before being downloaded the first time.
```
./scripts/init-whisper-asr-multilingual.sh
```
Then the service can be manually started/stoped with `docker start whisper` and `docker stop whisper`.

It could also be automatically started, but the ~5GB RAM used by the model might slow down the system.
For example in your `.bashrc` on Linux:
```
echo "
docker start whisper" >> ~/.bashrc
```
